/*
Write a Person class with an instance variable age and a constructor that takes an integer initialAge as a
parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed 
as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge initialAge the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
	If age < 13 print You are young..
	If age >= 13 and age < 18 print You are a teenager..
	Otherwise, print You are old..

To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you,
but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your 
Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!
Note: Do not remove or alter the stub code in the editor.

Input Format

Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases), and the T 
subsequent lines each contain an integer denoting age the of a Person instance.
